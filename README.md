## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Links

- [Github](https://github.com/chivicks-hazard/frontendmentor-responsive-product-card)
- [Live Site](https://frontendmentor-four-card-feature-section-snowy.vercel.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- TailwindCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://react.dev/) - JS library

### What I learned
I learnt a lot about placement of elements in the project because a lot of changes were made to get the desktop view correctly. It was not to get the mobile view because I was considering it first. Even though eventually most of the code was improved and perfected by ChatGPT, it does not mean that I am too lazy to make my research. It just an efficient way to get streamlined results faster.

### Continued development
I hope that with more practice, I will be able to improve my skills in placement of elements in a web page. This is a very important aspect of frontend development because the visual interface will not  look disorganized in one screen and look better in another one.

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This was very helpful in getting the right classes for each visual use and understanding more about the customization in TailwindCSS, being a utility first framework.
- [ChaGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) - Not only that this helped me in debugging my code, it also was helpful in getting the visual placement right for the desktop view. 

    PS: I sometimes wonder why you will write a line of code and it will not work but when the chatbot debugs it and gives you the exact code that was reaking and it works, you sometimes ask yourself if something is wrong with you ðŸ˜‚
